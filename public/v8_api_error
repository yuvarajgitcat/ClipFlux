# Custom API Response and Error Handling | Chai aur Code

## Overview

This video provides an in-depth guide on setting up a professional Node.js and Express backend project focusing on:

- Clean project architecture
- Middleware setup
- Standardized error handling and API responses
- Useful packages and best practices

These practices greatly improve backend maintainability, error traceability, and frontend integration consistency.

---

## Project Initialization & Structure

- **Use Express as the web server framework** for its simplicity and flexibility.
  
- Follow a **modular structure**:
  - `app.js` for Express app configuration.
  - Separate database connection logic, ensuring the server starts **only after a successful DB connection**.
  - Export the app instance for flexibility in server startup and testing.

- Use **environment variables** (`process.env`) for:
  - Port config (`PORT`)
  - Allowed CORS origins
  - Any other sensitive/configurable parameters

This enhances deployment flexibility between local, staging, and production environments.

## Essential Packages and Their Usage

1. **express**  
   Core web framework to handle routing, middleware, and responses.

2. **cookie-parser**  
   Middleware to parse cookies from incoming requests, important for managing authentication tokens or sessions.

3. **cors** (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)  
   Enables your backend to serve requests from frontend origins hosted elsewhere, essential for single-page apps communicating with APIs.

---

## Middleware Configuration Details

Middleware functions act as intermediaries before the request reaches route handlers or before sending the response.

### Common Middleware used:

- **CORS Setup**  
  Restrict frontend origins allowed to access backend resources.

  ```
  app.use(cors({
    origin: process.env.CORS_ORIGIN,  // Use whitelist or config string(s)
    credentials: true,                 // Allow credentials like cookies/auth headers
  }));
  ```

- **Cookie Parser**  
  Parses cookies from requests and populates `req.cookies`.

  ```
  app.use(cookieParser());
  ```

- **Body Parsing Middleware**  
  To parse JSON and URL encoded data from POST/PUT requests with size limits to avoid overloading the server.

  ```
  app.use(express.json({ limit: "16kb" }));
  app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true, limit: "16kb" }));
  ```

- **Static File Serving**  
  Serve public assets (images, frontend static builds) via designated folder.

  ```
  app.use(express.static("public"));
  ```

---

## What is Middleware and Why Use It?

- Functions with signature `(req, res, next)`.
- Can modify request or response objects or halt request flow.
- Enable cross-cutting concerns like logging, auth, and validation without cluttering route code.
- Always call `next()` (except error middleware) to pass control.
- Order of middleware registration matters â€” usually, setup general middleware before routes.

---

## Wrapping Async Route Handlers with Utility Function

Async route handlers often require try-catch blocks for error handling, leading to repetitive code.

### Solution: `asyncHandler` wrapper

```
const asyncHandler = (fn) => (req, res, next) =>
  Promise.resolve(fn(req, res, next))
    .catch(next);
```

- Wrap every async route handler with `asyncHandler`.
- Automatically forwards rejected promises/errors to Express's error middleware.
- Simplifies and reduces boilerplate in controller functions.

---

## Defining a Custom API Error Class

Standard errors thrown by the system or external libraries lack consistent structure.

Creating a custom `ApiError` class helps:

- Attach HTTP status codes.
- Add success flag (`false`) by default for errors.
- Include optional detailed error messages or arrays.
- Capture error stack for debugging.

```
class ApiError extends Error {
  constructor(statusCode, message = "Something went wrong", errors = [], stack = "") {
    super(message);                // Standard Error message
    this.statusCode = statusCode; // HTTP status code for response
    this.success = false;          // Indicates failure
    this.errors = errors;          // Array/object with additional error details
    
    if (stack) {
      this.stack = stack;
    } else {
      Error.captureStackTrace(this, this.constructor);
    }
  }
}
```

- Use this class whenever throwing errors manually in your business logic or validation.
- Facilitates uniform API error responses.

---

## Standardizing API Responses

Consistent API responses ease frontend integration and debugging.

### Recommended Response JSON format:

| Field    | Type     | Description                            |
|----------|----------|------------------------------------|
| success  | boolean  | `true` for success, `false` for error |
| message  | string   | Human-readable short message about result |
| data     | object/array/null | Payload of response for success cases |
| errors   | array    | Detailed errors, if any (for error cases) |

---

### Example Success Response

```
res.status(200).json({
  success: true,
  message: "Fetched user successfully",
  data: userObject,
});
```

---

### Example Error Response

```
res.status(err.statusCode || 500).json({
  success: false,
  message: err.message || "Internal server error",
  errors: err.errors || [],
});
```

---

## Express Error Middleware for Centralized Handling

Error middleware function signature requires four parameters: `(err, req, res, next)`.

- This middleware handles all errors passed via `next(err)` or thrown async errors.
- Converts errors to standardized response JSON.

```
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  res.status(err.statusCode || 500).json({
    success: false,
    message: err.message || "Internal error",
    errors: err.errors || [],
  });
});
```

Place this at the **end** of all routes and middleware to catch errors globally.

---

## Additional Best Practices and Tips

- **Start server after DB connection** to prevent runtime errors due to DB being unavailable.

- **Avoid wildcard (`*`) in CORS origin** in production; always specify frontend domains for security.

- **Use environment variables** to make app deployable to different environments without code changes.

- **Serve static assets separately** to keep backend logic clean and efficient.

- **Use meaningful HTTP status codes** (`400` for client errors, `401` for unauthorized, `404` for not found, `500` for server errors).

- When using cookies for sessions or tokens, ensure `httpOnly` and secure flags are properly configured.

- Test your error handling by provocation (e.g., sending invalid input, unauthorized access) to verify standardization.
